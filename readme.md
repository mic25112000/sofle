## Flashing

Flash using the correct command below (or use QMK Toolbox like me):

```sh
# for pro micro-based builds
qmk flash -kb sofle/rev2 -km keyhive_via -bl avrdude-split-left
qmk flash -kb sofle/rev2 -km keyhive_via -bl avrdude-split-right

# for Elite C or dfu bootloader builds
qmk flash -kb sofle/rev2 -km keyhive_via -bl dfu-split-left
qmk flash -kb sofle/rev2 -km keyhive_via -bl dfu-split-right
```

These commands can be mixed if, for example, you have an Elite C on the left and a pro micro on the right.
Press reset button on he keyboard when asked.

Disconnect the first half, connect the second one and repeat the process.
